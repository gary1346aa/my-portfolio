      </ul>

      <p>I studied music when I was in my high school, I was major in Violin, minor in Piano. 
        In my leisure time,I enjoy playing some pop musics.</p>
      <p> I also have a special talent - Perfect Pitch, which makes me easy to understand the 
        tone of every single chord in a song, or even the word when someone's talking.</p>

        PCs with custom appearence!</p>
